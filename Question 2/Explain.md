# Currying in JavaScript

## What is Currying?

**Currying** is a technique in JavaScript (and other programming languages) where a function with multiple arguments is transformed into a series of functions, each taking a single argument.

Think of it like this: instead of giving all the ingredients to a chef at once, you give them one by one, and they make a dish with each ingredient added step by step.

## Simple Example

Let's start with a simple example. Normally, a function might take two arguments and return the result.

With currying, we transform this function so that it takes one argument at a time, returning a new function that takes the next argument, and so on.

## More Flexible Curried Function

Now let's create a curried sum function that can handle a flexible number of arguments, like `sum(1, 2)(3)(4, 5, 6)`.

### Implementation

A simple way to implement a flexible curried sum function involves the following steps:

1. **Initial Function Call**: Starts the process and takes the first set of arguments.
2. **Inner Function**: Takes the next set of arguments and returns itself until an empty call is made.
3. **Sum Calculation**: When an empty call is made, it calculates the sum of all collected arguments.

### Step-by-Step Explanation

1. **Initial Call**:
   - The function takes initial arguments and returns another function.

2. **Subsequent Calls**:
   - Each call adds new arguments and returns another function.
   - This continues until an empty call is made.

3. **Sum Calculation**:
   - On the empty call, the function sums up all collected arguments and returns the result.

## Simplified Explanation

- **Currying** breaks down a function that takes multiple arguments into a series of functions that each take one argument.
- **Usage**: This is useful for creating functions that can be reused with some preset arguments or for making code more modular and readable.

## Practice with Simple Variants

1. **Basic Currying**:
   - Transform a basic function to take one argument at a time.

2. **Flexible Currying**:
   - Implement a function that can handle a variable number of arguments, accumulating them until a final action is performed (e.g., sum calculation).

## Conclusion

Currying transforms functions to take arguments one at a time, making them more flexible and modular. Practice creating curried functions to better understand and utilize this technique in your JavaScript coding.
